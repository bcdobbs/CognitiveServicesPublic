# Cognitive Services Public
Public repository with some basic python code for getting started with cognitive services.

Main code is in a Juypter notebook (CognitiveServices.ipynb). My preference is to use Anaconda with Visual Studio Code to open it.
You can open it direct in a browser from GitHub but not always on a mobile device.
